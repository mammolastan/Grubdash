# Grubdash

## Project Background
This project is an element of my Thinkful curriculum. The mock scenario is as follows: I've been hired as a backend developer for a new startup called GrubDash! As another developer works on the design and frontend experience, I was tasked with setting up an API and building out specific routes so that the frontend developers can demo some initial design ideas for the big bosses

## Tools
This project uses Express on NodeJS to set up an API which allows users to perform CRUD operations on orders data and inventory data
